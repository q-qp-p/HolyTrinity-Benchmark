# HolyTrinity Bench

**An adversarial security benchmark for agent authorization.** It measures one thing about
an authority control plane: the gap between an agent *proposing* a policy-violating action
and that action *producing an unauthorized external effect*. The agent is stipulated to be
compromised; the question is whether misbehavior converts to effect.

## The two papers

Both are readable here, in Markdown. Read them in this order:

1. **[The Model Proposes, the System Authorizes](PAPER-ARCHITECTURE.md)** — the architecture, and
   the paper that *specifies* this evaluation: the threat model, the invariant, and the metric
   this benchmark was built to measure. It pre-registers what would refute it.
2. **[Authority-Bound Agentic Execution: Measuring Unauthorized Effect Under Adversarial
   Load](PAPER.md)** — the evaluation itself: the campaign, the ablations, the intervals, and
   what the result does and does not establish.

`papers/` holds the LaTeX sources. Those are the archival record — the deposited Zenodo versions
hold exactly those files, verified by hash — not the copies you are meant to read. The Markdown
above is generated from them and checked against them by `scoring/check_paper_sync.py`, which
fails if a number appears in one and not the other. That gate exists because these renderings have
drifted before, and both times the Markdown kept a figure the LaTeX had already retracted.

## Headline result

Across **73 trials** (61 attack trials + 12 known-good controls) against the system under
test, a violating action was constructed and driven in **57 of the 61 attack trials** and produced
**0 unauthorized external effects** (per-trial 95% CI [0.0%, 5.9%]; cluster-aware ≤32.4% over the
8 distinct mechanisms the set exercises — see `REPORT.md`). A zero is what a reviewer distrusts, so it is not presented
alone — the benchmark backs it with:

- an **ablation study** (disable each mechanism; its attacks convert — 0→10, 0→5, 0→5, 0→14 for
  the content firewall, runtime sentinel, skill auditor and approval binding, and 0→2 for
  two-person approval: five mechanisms, each demonstrated necessary);
- a **no-control baseline** (whole membrane off → **51 of 63 trials** convert) — where 63 is not
  a count of attacks but the F1–F5 + F8 totals, including 8 known-good controls and F8's 4
  non-attacks, and is not the campaign's 61 either, because the baseline set omits F6, F7 and F9,
  which have no runtime toggle;
- a **measured trusted-computing-base boundary** (each ablatable element removed in turn with the
  full 73-trial catalog driven against it, so 41 provider-call trials are live under every ablation:
  only the kernel element's failure admits a provider-call effect, surface reducers admit
  gate-channel effects only. Scope is stated rather than implied — single removals only, and F6/F7/F9
  plus the membrane and durable store are never ablated — `REPORT.md`, paper §9.1);
- a **kept-and-fixed failure** (the one effect an earlier run leaked, closed and re-measured);
- **confidence intervals** on every rate and an **independent-oracle calibration** (0 overclaims
  in 41 provider-call trials; on all 6 trials where a real effect occurred the system's proof state
  matched the independent verdict — `REPORT.md` gives the decomposition, which is the honest form
  of the claim).

## Reproducibility — partial, stated honestly

This repository open-sources **the benchmark and its results, not the system under test.**
The Trinity control plane is patent-pending and not yet public, so the campaign is **not
re-executable end-to-end here.** Two things are checkable now:

1. **Results are auditable from the released artifacts.** Every campaign number and table follows
   mechanically from the committed JSONL (`artifacts/`). The `scoring/` modules recompute
   them without the system. Every other published table recomputes the same way, from per-trial
   records that ship alongside: the ablation study, the no-control ceiling, the compound ablation,
   the four full-catalog §9.1 probes, overhead, false denials, F10, and the blind-set result. What
   the artifacts do not settle is **scope** — which runs exist at all — and that is stated at each
   table rather than left to be inferred. `MANIFEST.md` and `artifacts/README.md` say the same
   thing; read each artifact's `_meta.caveat` for what its run can and cannot support.
2. **The method is inspectable** — the frozen specification, the family taxonomy, the released
   family definitions, the declarative blind-attack sets, the scoring modules, and **the full
   harness: the independent oracle, the aggressor, the runner, and the ablation / TCB /
   measurement-integrity / blind drivers**. These reference the system under test, so they do not
   compile standalone; they are published so the adjudication method can be checked line by line
   rather than taken on trust.

Full end-to-end re-execution becomes possible when the system under test is released.

## Verify a receipt yourself

`receipt-verification/` holds what you need to check a Trinity authority receipt **without
trusting us**: the public key registry, two independent offline verifiers, and a corpus that
exercises every verdict they can produce.

**What you can establish on your own.** That a receipt's signature is genuine under a key you
obtained from here rather than from whoever handed you the receipt; that the key's standing at the
time the receipt says it was signed permits that signature; and that a receipt whose visible fields
disagree with its signed bytes is refused rather than accepted. No network, no packages, no build.

**What you cannot establish from this directory alone.** That the events described in a receipt
happened. A signature binds a record to a signer and to a position in a chain; it does not witness
the world.

**Pins.** Two annotated tags name immutable points: `receipt-verification-r1` and
`receipt-verification-r2`. Cite a tag rather than a branch if you need a fixed reference.

**Start with `receipt-verification/verifier/VERDICTS.md`** — one row per verdict case, the input
that produces it, and the order the checks run in. It is the single source the verifiers and their
cross-check are held to.

## What is not here

The **system under test** (the Trinity control plane) and the **held red-team corpora** for the
content/runtime/skill families (F1–F3) — their contents are the detection surface those mechanisms
are tuned against, so releasing them would be a defensive-hardening problem rather than an IP one.
The harness that drives the benchmark **is** released; it simply cannot compile without the system.
